Overview

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.

This lab uses transfer learning to train your machine. In transfer learning, when you build a new model to classify your original dataset, you reuse the feature extraction part and re-train the classification part with your dataset. This method uses less computational resources and training time. Deep learning from scratch can take days, but transfer learning can be done in short order.

What you'll do

1. Examine and understand your image data
2. Build an input pipeline using Keras ImageDataGenerator
3. Use a pre-trained model for feature extraction
4. Fine-tune a pre-trained model
